Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications easier and more efficient. In this post, I'll share my experience with Next.js and why I think it's a great choice for modern web development.

## Why Next.js?

There are several reasons why Next.js has become my go-to framework:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Next.js makes it easy to implement SSR, which improves performance and SEO.
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - You can pre-render pages at build time for even better performance.
3. **File-based Routing** - The intuitive file-based routing system makes navigation simple.
4. **API Routes** - Built-in API routes allow you to create serverless functions easily.

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward:

```javascript
// Install Next.js
npx create-next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app

// Start the development server
npm run dev
